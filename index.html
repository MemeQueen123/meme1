      <h3 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Dr. Wong's life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Toronto, Canada</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend Harvard University, thanks to a Depression era
          program known as the
          "National Weaboo Administration"
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works
          in the Online Conservation Corps, helping starving Gamers. "I saw
          how cheetoes changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US
          D&D Preservation Service
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Snow Angel Yuki. Gets
          laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Benito Mussolini, he
          returns to school study under Stalin, who teaches him about breeding
          pest-resistent fascists.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the attack on Wall Maria, but is rejected.
          Instead, the military asked his lab to
          work on waterproof glue, DDT to control titans, disinfectants, and
          other applied science.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Gaming and Plant Pathology
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Steam,
          leaves behind his pregnant angel wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
          pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
          different strains of disease resistent cheetoes - including different
          varieties for each major basement on Earth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grow doritos twice each
          season, doubling snack yields
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of hot-pocket
          with a high-yielding American breed, creating a strain that responds
          well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's microwaveable foods.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Tokyo and brings his high-yielding
          strains of hot-pocket to the Asian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
          mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding gaming population
        </li>
        <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
          increase their dorito and sorghum yields
        </li>

          University
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world microwaveable food
          supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
          we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
          are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
          plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
          people were selecting the best breeds."
        </li>
        <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
      </ul>
